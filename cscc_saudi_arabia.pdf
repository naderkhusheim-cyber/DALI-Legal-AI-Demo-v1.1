Introduction
The National Cybersecurity Authority (referred to in this document as "NCA")
developed the Essential Cybersecurity Controls (ECC - 1 : 2018) to set the minimum
cybersecurity requirements for organizations. As an extension and a complement to ECC,
the Critical Systems Cybersecurity Controls (CSCC - 1 : 2019) was developed to fit the
cybersecurity needs for national critical systems.
The CSCC was developed after conducting a comprehensive study of multiple national
and international cybersecurity frameworks and standards, studying related national
decisions, law and regulatory requirements, reviewing and leveraging cybersecurity best
practices, analyzing previous cybersecurity incidents and attacks on government and other
critical organizations, and conducting public consultations.
During the development of these controls, NCA considered the alignment between
CSCC and ECC (which is a prerequisite for compliance with CSCC). The organizations
must continuously comply with ECC in order to be fully compliant with the CSCC. for
that, the CSCC consists of the following:
• 4 Main Domains
• 21 Subdomains
• 32 Main Controls
• 73 Subcontrols

Objectives
As an extension to ECC, the CSCC aims to enable organizations and build their protection
and cyber resilience capabilities against cyber attacks, and sustain information technology
assets for critical systems. The CSCC was developed based on international standards and best
practices in order to meet the current security needs and raise organizations' preparedness to
face the growing cybersecurity risks against their critical systems that may result in negative
impacts and significant losses on the national level.

Definition and Identification Criteria of Critical Systems
Critical Systems Definition
Any system or network whose failure, unauthorized change to its operation, unauthorized
access to it, or to the data stored or processed by it; may result in negative impact on the
organization’s businesses and services’ availability, or cause negative economic, financial,
security or social impacts on the national level.
Critical Systems Identification Criteria
The following are the criteria that may be used by organizations to identify critical systems
they own:
1. Negative impact on national security.
2. Negative impact on the Kingdom’s reputation and public image.
3. Significant financial losses (i.e., more than 0.01% of GDP).
4. Negative impact on the services provided to a large number of users (i.e., more
than 5% of the population)
5. Loss of lives.
6. Unauthorized disclosure of data that is classified as Top Secret or Secret.
7. Negative impact on the operations of one (or more) vital sector(s).

Scope of Work and Applicability
CSCC Scope of Work
These controls are applicable to systems deemed critical (as per the criteria forementioned
in this document) by the organizations who own or operate these systems, whether they
are government organizations in the kingdom or abroad (e.g., ministries, authorities,
establishments, embassies and others), subsidiaries of government or private organizations,
which are all referred to herein as “Organization”.
CSCC Statement of Applicability
Every organization must comply with all applicable controls after assessing the extent of
impact and conducting necessary checks before implementation. Some controls' applicability
differs from one organization to another, for example:
• Controls in Subdomain 4-2 (Cloud Computing and Hosting Cybersecurity) are
applicable and must be implemented by organizations currently using or planning to use
cloud computing and hosting services.

Implementation and Compliance
In order to comply with item 3 of article 10 of NCA’s mandate, and as per the Royal
Decree number 57231, dated 10/11/1439H, and the Royal Decree number 7732, dated
12/2/1440H, all organizations within the scope of the CSCC must:
1. Identify the organization's critical systems using (Critical Systems Identification
Criteria).
2. Implement all necessary measures to comply with these controls on the identified
critical systems within the compliance period defined by NCA, provided that
cybersecurity risks are assessed and managed to minimize potential risks during
the defined compliance period.
3. Ensure the continuous compliance after the defined compliance period.
NCA evaluates the organizations' compliance with the CSCC through multiple means
such as self-assessments by the organizations themselves, and/or on-site audits, in
accordance with the mechanisms deemed appropriate by the NCA.
Update and Review
NCA will periodically review and update the CSCC as per the related industry cybersecurity
updates. NCA will communicate and publish the updated version of CSCC for implementation
and compliance.
