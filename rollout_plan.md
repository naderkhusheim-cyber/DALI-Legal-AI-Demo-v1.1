# Rollout Plan and Change Management Strategy

## Introduction

This document outlines the rollout plan and change management strategy for the internal Legal LLM and RAG system. The goal is to ensure a smooth and successful adoption of the new system by all lawyers in the firm.

## Rollout Plan

The rollout will be conducted in three phases:

- **Phase 1: Pilot Program (2-3 months):** A small group of lawyers will be selected to participate in a pilot program. The goal of the pilot program is to gather feedback on the system and to identify any issues before the system is rolled out to the entire firm.
- **Phase 2: Departmental Rollout (3-6 months):** The system will be rolled out to one department at a time. This will allow the project team to provide focused training and support to each department.
- **Phase 3: Firm-wide Rollout (6-12 months):** The system will be rolled out to the entire firm. This will be accompanied by a firm-wide communication and training campaign.

## Change Management Strategy

The change management strategy is designed to minimize resistance to change and to ensure a smooth transition to the new system. It consists of the following key elements:

- **Communication:** A comprehensive communication plan will be developed to keep all stakeholders informed about the project. The communication plan will include regular updates on the project status, as well as information about the benefits of the new system.
- **Training:** A comprehensive training program will be developed to ensure that all lawyers are proficient in using the new system. The training program will include both online and in-person training, as well as a variety of training materials, such as user guides, videos, and quick reference cards.
- **Support:** A dedicated support team will be available to provide assistance to users during and after the rollout. The support team will be available to answer questions, troubleshoot issues, and provide one-on-one coaching.
- **Incentives:** An incentive program will be developed to encourage adoption of the new system. The incentive program may include rewards for early adopters, as well as recognition for users who demonstrate a high level of proficiency in using the system.
