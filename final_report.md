This guide is intended to provide a clear roadmap for law firms and legal departments looking to leverage AI to improve efficiency, enhance client service, and maintain compliance with Saudi Arabian regulations.




## 1. Regulatory and Compliance Landscape in Saudi Arabia

### 1.1. Legal and Judicial Structure

Saudi Arabia's legal system is deeply rooted in Islamic law (Shari'ah), which governs both criminal and civil matters. The King serves as the highest court of appeal and holds the power of pardon. The legal framework does not distinguish between religious and secular domains, making Shari'ah the supreme law of the land.

The court system is comprised of three main pillars:

1.  **Shari'ah Courts:** These courts handle the majority of cases and are divided into Courts of First Instance (Summary and General Courts), Courts of Cassation, and the Supreme Judicial Council.
2.  **Board of Grievances:** This body adjudicates cases involving the government and administrative disputes.
3.  **Specialized Government Committees:** Housed within various ministries, these committees resolve specific disputes, such as labor and commercial issues.

In 2007, a royal decree initiated a significant reorganization of the judicial system, leading to the establishment of a Supreme Court, as well as specialized commercial, labor, and administrative courts.

The primary sources of Shari'ah law are the Holy Qur'an and the Sunnah (the practices and sayings of Prophet Muhammad). These are supplemented by the Ijma' (the consensus of Muslim scholars) and Qias (reasoning by analogy).

### 1.2. Code of Law Practice

The practice of law in Saudi Arabia is regulated by the Code of Law Practice, which is enforced by the Ministry of Justice. Key provisions of the code include:

-   **Definition of Law Practice:** The practice of law encompasses representation before courts, the Board of Grievances, and other judicial committees, as well as providing legal consultancy based on Shari'ah principles.
-   **Licensing and Registration:** To practice law in Saudi Arabia, lawyers must be Saudi nationals (with some exceptions), hold a degree in Shari'ah or law, have at least three years of practical experience, and meet stringent character and conduct requirements.
-   **Professional Duties:** Lawyers are obligated to practice in accordance with Shari'ah and the laws of the Kingdom, uphold the dignity of the profession, and avoid conflicts of interest.

### 1.3. Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL)
